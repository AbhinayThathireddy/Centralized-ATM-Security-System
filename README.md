# Centralized ATM Security System
It is an IoT-based ATM security system integrating sensors, a microcontroller, Wi-Fi, and Google
Assistant for advanced security monitoring and control. The system detects unauthorized access using a
Hall-effect sensor, provides real-time alerts, and offers live camera feed via a Flask server.
